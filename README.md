# E-Plane and H-Plane Tees (Microwave Engineering)

📡 This project demonstrates the design and simulation of **E-Plane Tee** and **H-Plane Tee** waveguide junctions using **ANSYS HFSS**, as part of Microwave Engineering studies.

---

## 🔹 Project Overview
- **E-Plane Tee:** A 3-port waveguide junction where the auxiliary arm is connected in the *electric (E)* field plane of the main waveguide.  
- **H-Plane Tee:** A 3-port waveguide junction where the auxiliary arm is connected in the *magnetic (H)* field plane of the main waveguide.  

These components are widely used in microwave circuits for **power division, signal injection, and phase control**.
